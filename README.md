## GETTING STARTED WITH COCOAPODS:
To create a new project with CocoaPods, follow the instructions below:

1. Create a new project in Xcode as you would normally, then close the project.
2. Open a Terminal window, and $ cd into your project directory.
3. Create a Podfile. This can be done by running `pod init`.
4. Open your Podfile with a text editor, and add the following:
```
pod 'BackendlessSwift'
```
5. Save Podfile, return to Terminal window and run `pod install` and `pod update`. Once all of the pod data is downloaded/updated, Xcode project workspace file will be created. This is the file you must open when working on your app.
6. Open .xcworkspace file to launch your project.
